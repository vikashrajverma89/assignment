    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - Precision answers the question: \"Of all instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\"\n",
    "  - It focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:**\n",
    "  - High precision is desirable when the cost of false positives (Type I errors) is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate):\n",

    "### Trade-off Between Precision and Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balancing Act:**\n",
    "  - There is often a trade-off between precision and recall. Improving one may lead to a decrease in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusting Thresholds:**\n",
    "  - The classification threshold can be adjusted to influence precision and recall. A lower threshold may increase recall but decrease precision, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario-based Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a spam email detection model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Precision:**\n",
    "  - If the model predicts an email as spam, it is highly likely to be spam. (Few false positives)\n",
    "  - Precision is important to avoid marking legitimate emails as spam.\n",

    "### Implementation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn provide built-in support for multiclass logistic regression using both OvR and OvO strategies. The choice between OvR and OvO can often be specified as a parameter in the library's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example using scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load your multiclass dataset\n",
    "X, y = load_multiclass_data()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the data into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logistic regression model with OvR (default in scikit-learn)\n",
    "model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='ovr', solver='liblinear')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions\n",
    "y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate accuracy\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `multi_class` parameter is set to 'ovr' by default, which signifies the One-vs-Rest strategy. If you want to use One-vs-One, you can set `multi_class` to 'multinomial'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs')\n",
    "```\n",
