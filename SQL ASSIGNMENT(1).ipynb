    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to store, retrieve, and manage information. Databases are used to store data for various applications, including websites, business applications, mobile apps, and more. They provide a systematic way to store and manage data efficiently, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a differentiation between SQL (Relational) and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Model:\n",
    "        SQL (Relational): SQL databases use a structured, tabular format where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Each table has a predefined schema that defines the data types and relationships between tables.\n",
    "        NoSQL: NoSQL databases are more flexible in terms of data modeling. They can use various data models, including document-oriented (like JSON or BSON), key-value, column-family, or graph-based models. The choice of data model depends on the specific NoSQL database type.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scalability:\n",
    "        SQL (Relational): SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, which means you can increase their capacity by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single server. Horizontal scaling can be more challenging and may require complex partitioning strategies.\n",
    "        NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes easily. This makes them suitable for handling large amounts of data and high-velocity workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Query Language:\n",
    "        SQL (Relational): SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval. SQL is powerful and well-suited for complex queries and joins.\n",
    "        NoSQL: NoSQL databases often have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data model. The query capabilities may be less expressive than SQL but are tailored to the data model's strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consistency and ACID Properties:\n",
    "        SQL (Relational): SQL databases typically follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and consistency even in the presence of failures.\n",
    "        NoSQL: NoSQL databases may relax some ACID properties for greater scalability and performance. They often use a BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, which sacrifices immediate consistency for improved availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Cases:\n",
    "        SQL (Relational): SQL databases are well-suited for applications with structured data, complex relationships, and the need for strong consistency, such as financial systems, traditional business applications, and data warehousing.\n",
    "        NoSQL: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with dynamic, unstructured, or semi-structured data, where high scalability, low-latency reads and writes, and flexibility in data modeling are essential. Examples include social media platforms, content management systems, IoT data storage, and real-time analytics.\n",

DDL statements are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects. Here are explanations of some common DDL statements:\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " CREATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "    Example: Creating a new table named \"Customers\" in a relational database:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    Phone VARCHAR(15)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. It permanently removes the object and its data.\n",
    "    Example: Dropping the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    DROP TABLE Customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table.\n",
    "    Example: Adding a new column \"Address\" to the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE Customers\n",
    "    ADD Address VARCHAR(200);\n",
    "    \n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all the data from a table, but it retains the table structure for future use. It is faster and more efficient than the DELETE statement for removing all records from a table.\n",
    "    Example: Truncating the \"Orders\" table:\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE Orders;\n",
