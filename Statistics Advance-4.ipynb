    "\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = \\frac{t \\cdot s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n",

    "Where:\n",

    "- \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect of Sample Size on Margin of Error:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inverse Relationship:** The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size (\\( n \\)). As the sample size increases, the square root of \\( n \\) increases, resulting in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Larger Sample, Smaller Margin of Error:** Increasing the sample size leads to a more precise estimate. With a larger sample, the variability within the sample tends to reflect the variability in the population more accurately, resulting in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example comparing the margin of error for two different sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are estimating the average height of a population. We have two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 1 (Smaller Sample):**\n",
    "  - Sample size (\\( n_1 \\)) = 25\n",
    "  - Margin of Error (\\( MOE_1 \\)) = \\( \\frac{t \\cdot s}{\\sqrt{n_1}} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 2 (Larger Sample):**\n",
    "  - Sample size (\\( n_2 \\)) = 100\n",
    "  - Margin of Error (\\( MOE_2 \\)) = \\( \\frac{t \\cdot s}{\\sqrt{n_2}} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming other factors remain constant, the margin of error for Scenario 2 (\\( MOE_2 \\)) will be smaller than the margin of error for Scenario 1 (\\( MOE_1 \\)) due to the larger sample size in Scenario 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the principle that larger sample sizes provide more information and result in more precise estimates of population parameters."
